# Exercise 0: 
# Taken from http://codekata.com/kata/kata11-sorting-it-out/ (Sorting Characters)

# Our resident conspiracy expert, Dr. X, is looking for hidden messages in
# the collected publications of Hugh Hefner. Dr. X believes the message is
# hidden in the individual letters, so rather than get distracted by the words,
# heâ€™s asked us to write a program to take a block of text and return the
# letters it contains, sorted. Given the text:

# "When not studying nuclear physics, Bambi likes to play beach volleyball."
# our program would return:
# "aaaaabbbbcccdeeeeeghhhiiiiklllllllmnnnnooopprsssstttuuvwyyyy"
# The program ignores punctuation, and maps upper case to lower case.

# If you finish all exercises (1-5) and still feel like doing more:
# Solve Exercise 0 without using build-in functions, think of a way which would
# perform very well - short running time and using little memory.

# tip: focus on simple requirement at a time
# tip: code your solution in functions so you can run and test them with multiple
# different input values easily
